# Python Task - Spot.IM

My program will prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, it will print "Niv" instead of the number and for the multiples of five, it will print "8200". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, it will print "Niv8200". 
## Usage

```bash
sudo docker build -t python_task .
sudo docker run python_task 
```
